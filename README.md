# StockX Java Kata

> In this repository you'll find **StockX Kata**. This Java test is to know wich one were our actual level in software developing applying techiques we have learned. Follow with coherence the OOP paradigm, make a correct TDD process and apply the SOLID Principles, develop a program from the itnerpretation of an UML diagram and following the user stories.

## Motivation

One of my biggest motivation was to challenge myself. It was an enjoyable test for my teacher and for me too. I tried to show how capable I am and how much I learned in just a few months. I've pushed myyself as hard as I could. This one has been my first ever code technic practice and I've enjoyed and i learned so much from it. I know I'm not going to forget never the mistakes I've done and I'm going always to keep the tips and values I've learned from this test. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as me if you fancy to try it.

## Reflections

My point of view of this test is really good. I think had been the three hours that I've learned more since I've started. It helped me to deal with unpredicted situations that someone never expect and how to deal with the stress. Even knowing I've done some mistakes I could avoid easly, I've learned new things I'm going to keep. Never before I've done a test of coding and i was suprised of how good I was dealing with it. This kata is based in all principles, procedures, paradigms,... that our teacher has been teaching to us since we started, the most important and to keep in mind before try this test are:

* OOP 
* TDD 
* DDD
* SOLID Principles
    * Single Responsability 
    * Open Close 
    * Liskov Substitution 
    * Interface Segregation
    * Dependency Inversion

All publics test, to anyone that alredy know about the coding, Java and all the main points referenced before. I hope you'll enjoy as much as me and it will make you feel happiness when you get a overcome a new user story, anger when you'll get stuck and a clever amaze when you'll get to the answer by one of the ways you've never expected.
